input is a wikipedia URL where theres a table identifying the selected team for 2021. 
data is scraped, and saved.
-> could save data to file for reference in future. data must be labelled with the date and time of acquisition.
data is cleaned to remove unnecessary fields and NaN fields.
ages of team are counted, and a bar chart is produced to show this visually.

to do:
-> create function to make the 'loading' of data easier.

-> make a separate entry of the captain's age.
-> get a list ranking end position of the teams.
-> compare this to averages of team age and captain age.
